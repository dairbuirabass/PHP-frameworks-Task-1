# PHP.-Task-1

<b>Description:</b> 
Code can be tested with PHP â€” ```php -S localhost:8000 index.php```
The MVC components are in separate files to demonstrate real-life advantage in avoiding conflicts for people working in large teams.

<b>Process:</b>
First I wanted to use <i>EventListeners</i> to handle communication between Model and View classes. This was successfully implemented by me in JavaScript MVC example. However, due mostly to the lack of knowledge I could not achieve desired results. I created classes and assigned parameters to them. Handling the press event is made with PHP's ```isset``` and ```GET``` functions.

<b>References: </b>
Implementation is strongly influenced by Callum Hopkins and his article <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/the-mvc-pattern-and-php-1/">about MVC pattern and PHP on <i>sitepoint.com</i></a>. It is the part one of his series on MVC pattern in plain PHP
